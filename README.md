# Telecom-Project
 Projeto referente a Formação Cientista de Dados da Data Science Academy
 
 ## Description
 
 Customer churn can refer to the loss of customers in a particular company. Customer loyalty and Customer churn always add up to 100%. If a company has a loyalty rate of 60%, then  the customer loss rate is 40%. Under the 80/20 profitability rule, 20% of customers are generating 80% of revenue. Therefore, it is important to anticipate the users who are likely to leave the business and the factors that affect the customer's decisions.

In this project, I used an algorithm to predict the Customer Churn of a Telecom Companie.
